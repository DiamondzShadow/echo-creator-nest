# Stream Source Improvements - Summary

## Issues Addressed

### 1. ‚úÖ Instant Stream Not Connecting to Livepeer
**Problem:** The instant stream camera preview worked, but didn't properly broadcast to Livepeer when clicking "Go Live". Only streaming software (OBS) worked.

**Root Cause:** The `Broadcast.Root` component wasn't re-initializing when the `streamKey` prop changed. The component was mounted before the stream key was available, and didn't reconnect when it became available.

**Solution:** 
- Added `key={broadcastKey}` to force component re-mount when streamKey changes
- Added debug logging to track when broadcasting is enabled
- Component now properly transitions from preview ‚Üí live broadcasting

### 2. ‚úÖ Added Pull Stream Feature (YouTube, TikTok, IG, etc.)
**Problem:** No way to use external streams as sources.

**Solution:** Implemented complete pull stream functionality allowing users to:
- Re-stream from YouTube Live
- Re-stream from Twitch
- Re-stream from TikTok Live
- Re-stream from any RTMP/HLS source

## New Features

### üé• Pull Stream Capability

Users can now pull streams from external sources and re-broadcast through Livepeer!

**Supported Sources:**
- YouTube Live (HLS or RTMP)
- Twitch (HLS or RTMP)
- TikTok Live (RTMP)
- Instagram Live (RTMP with restrictions)
- Any RTMP/RTMPS/HLS stream URL

**Benefits:**
- Multi-platform streaming (stream to YouTube AND your app simultaneously)
- Decentralized re-broadcasting
- Low-latency playback for your viewers
- Automatic recording and transcoding
- Custom branding on external streams

## Files Created

### 2. `src/components/InstantLiveStream.tsx`
**Changes:**
- Added `broadcastKey` to force re-mount when streamKey changes
- Added debug logging with emojis for better visibility
- Added `useEffect` to log when broadcasting is enabled
- Component now properly transitions from preview to live broadcast

**Key Addition:**
```typescript
const broadcastKey = streamKey || 'preview';

## Important Notes

### Platform Terms of Service

‚ö†Ô∏è **Before using pull streams, review each platform's TOS:**

- **YouTube**: Generally allows embedding and sharing public streams
- **Twitch**: Affiliates/Partners have exclusivity agreements
- **TikTok**: Check developer terms
- **Instagram**: Has strict re-streaming policies

### Technical Considerations

1. **Latency**: Pull streams add ~5-10s latency
2. **Quality**: Limited by source stream quality
3. **Bandwidth**: Livepeer ingests and transcodes (uses bandwidth)
4. **Reliability**: Dependent on source platform uptime
5. **Cost**: Livepeer charges for transcoding minutes

### Best Practices

1. Always test with a short stream first
2. Monitor stream health in Livepeer Studio
3. Have a backup direct streaming option
4. Use HLS sources when possible (more reliable)
5. Consider geographic proximity to source

## Troubleshooting

### Instant Stream Issues

**"Camera works but stream doesn't connect"**
- Check browser console for "Broadcasting enabled with ingestUrl"
- Verify stream key is correct
- Check Livepeer Studio dashboard for active stream
- Try refreshing the page

**"No ingest URL in console"**
- Ensure you clicked "Go Live"
- Check that `isLive` prop is true
- Verify `streamKey` prop is set
- Look for errors in console

### Pull Stream Issues

**"Failed to create pull stream"**
- Verify URL is valid and accessible
- Ensure source stream is actually live
- Check if source requires authentication
- Test URL in VLC or similar player first

**"Stream buffering constantly"**
- Source stream may have network issues
- Try lower quality source
- Check if source is overloaded
- Use different stream format (HLS vs RTMP)

**"Pull stream shows offline"**
- Wait 30-60 seconds for initialization
- Check if source stream ended
- Verify in Livepeer Studio dashboard
- Check edge function logs
