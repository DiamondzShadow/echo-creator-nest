# Livestreaming Improvements - Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Camera Preview Not Showing**
**Problem:** The `InstantLiveStream` component was managing camera access manually with `getUserMedia()`, causing conflicts when switching to Livepeer's Broadcast component.

**Solution:** 
- Refactored to use `Broadcast.Root` from the start for both preview and live streaming
- Removed manual `getUserMedia()` approach
- Added `Broadcast.Container` to properly wrap the video element
- The `ingestUrl` is only set when `isLive=true`, enabling seamless transition from preview to live

### 2. **No Upstream Routing to Livepeer**
**Problem:** Camera stream wasn't being routed to Livepeer's infrastructure.

**Solution:**
- Implemented proper WebRTC WHIP broadcasting using `getIngest(streamKey)`
- Stream now properly broadcasts to Livepeer when "Go Live" is clicked
- Added `Broadcast.LoadingIndicator` for better UX during connection

### 3. **Missing Low-Latency Playback**
**Problem:** Using iframe embed (`lvpr.tv`) instead of Livepeer Player primitives.

**Solution:**
- Replaced iframe with `@livepeer/react/player` components
- Implemented playback info API through Supabase function (secure backend call)
- Added `getSrc()` to parse playback sources (WebRTC + HLS)
- **Result:** WebRTC playback with 0.5-3s latency, automatic fallback to HLS (~10s)

### 4. **Outdated LivepeerProvider**
**Problem:** Using deprecated provider pattern from older Livepeer SDK version.

**Solution:**
- Removed non-functional `LivepeerProvider` wrapper
- Updated to use standalone Broadcast/Player components (v4.x API)

## New Features Added

### ðŸ“¹ **WebRTC Low-Latency Streaming**
- **Broadcast:** Browser-based streaming with WebRTC WHIP
- **Playback:** WebRTC WHEP with 0.5-3s latency
- **Fallback:** Automatic fallback to HLS if WebRTC fails

### ðŸŽ¥ **Enhanced Player**
- Custom controls (play/pause, seek, volume, fullscreen)
- Live indicator badge
- Loading states
- Automatic source selection (WebRTC â†’ HLS)

### âš¡ **Optimized Stream Profiles**
Updated profiles for low-latency performance:
- **1080p:** 6 Mbps, 2s keyframe interval
- **720p:** 3 Mbps, 2s keyframe interval  
- **480p:** 1.5 Mbps, 2s keyframe interval
- **360p:** 800 Kbps, 2s keyframe interval
- **Recording:** Enabled for clips/VOD

### ðŸ”’ **Security Improvements**
- Playback info fetched through backend (Supabase function)
- No CORS-enabled API keys exposed to frontend
- Follows Livepeer best practices for API security

## Architecture

### Broadcasting Flow:
```
User Camera â†’ Broadcast.Root â†’ WebRTC WHIP â†’ Livepeer Ingest â†’ Transcoding
```

### Playback Flow:
```
PlaybackId â†’ Supabase Function â†’ Livepeer API â†’ getSrc() â†’ Player.Root
                                                              â†“
                                                      WebRTC (0.5-3s) 
                                                      â†“ (fallback)
                                                      HLS (~10s)
```

## Files Modified

1. **`src/components/InstantLiveStream.tsx`**
   - Complete refactor to use Broadcast.Root throughout
   - Simplified state management
   - Proper WebRTC broadcasting setup

- Add `Player.ClipTrigger` component
- Allow viewers to clip live moments
- Store clips as assets

### 2. **Thumbnails**
- Fetch and display live thumbnails
