# Stream Freeze on Viewer Join - Fix

## Problem Description

Live streams were freezing when viewers tuned in, even though the broadcaster could see themselves and the stream showed as "live" with viewer counts updating.

## Root Cause

**LiveKit Egress (Recording) Timing Conflict**

When a broadcaster went live, the following sequence caused connection overload:

```
1. Broadcaster publishes video/audio tracks     [0ms]
2. Stream marked as is_live: true               [0ms]
3. Egress starts recording (joins as participant) [0ms]
4. Viewer sees "live" and joins room            [100-500ms]
5. ❌ FREEZE - Too many connections at once
```

**Why this caused freezing:**

1. **Connection Congestion**: Egress joins the room as a hidden participant immediately after the broadcaster
2. **Bandwidth Competition**: Broadcaster is simultaneously:
   - Publishing to egress recorder
   - Publishing to viewer
   - Maintaining connection to LiveKit server
3. **Adaptive Stream Overload**: LiveKit's adaptive streaming tries to optimize for multiple participants instantly
4. **WebRTC Negotiation**: Multiple ICE negotiations happening at the same time

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Delayed Egress Start (Primary Fix)

**File**: `src/pages/Live.tsx`

Added a **3-second delay** before starting recording:

```typescript
// Wait 3 seconds to ensure broadcaster's connection is stable
setTimeout(async () => {
  console.log('📹 Now starting recording...');
  // Start egress...
}, 3000);
```

**Why this works:**
- Broadcaster's connection fully stabilizes before egress joins
- Viewers can join during the 3-second window without conflict
- Egress joins after the room is already stable with viewers
- Eliminates simultaneous connection negotiations

### 2. Improved Room Configuration

**File**: `src/lib/livekit-config.ts`

Enhanced LiveKit room settings for better multi-participant handling:

```typescript
const room = new Room({
  adaptiveStream: true,
  dynacast: true,
  stopLocalTrackOnUnpublish: true,
  disconnectOnPageLeave: true,
});

await room.connect(LIVEKIT_URL, token, { 
  autoSubscribe: true,
  maxRetries: 3,
  peerConnectionTimeout: 15000,
});
```

**New settings:**
- `stopLocalTrackOnUnpublish`: Prevents zombie tracks
- `disconnectOnPageLeave`: Cleans up connections properly
- `maxRetries: 3`: Limits retry attempts to prevent connection loops
- `peerConnectionTimeout: 15000`: 15-second timeout for cleaner failures

### 3. Egress-Aware Viewer Count

**File**: `src/components/InstantLiveStreamLiveKit.tsx`

Fixed viewer count to exclude egress recorder:

```typescript
newRoom.on(RoomEvent.ParticipantConnected, (participant) => {
  // Filter out egress participants
  const isEgressParticipant = participant.identity?.startsWith('EG_') || 
                               participant.metadata?.includes('egress');
  
  if (isEgressParticipant) {
    console.log('📹 Egress recorder joined (not counted as viewer)');
  }
  
  // Count only actual viewers
  const actualViewers = Array.from(newRoom.remoteParticipants.values())
    .filter(p => !p.identity?.startsWith('EG_') && !p.metadata?.includes('egress'))
    .length;
  setViewerCount(actualViewers);
});
```

**Benefits:**
- Accurate viewer count (excludes recorder)
- Better logging for debugging
- Prevents confusion about participant types

### 4. Enhanced Connection Monitoring

Added better connection quality feedback:

```typescript
newRoom.on(RoomEvent.ConnectionQualityChanged, (quality, participant) => {
  if (participant === newRoom.localParticipant && quality === 'excellent') {
    console.log('✅ Connection quality is excellent');
  }
});
```

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Test Without Recording

1. Go to `/live`
2. **Disable** "Record Stream" toggle
3. Start stream
4. Open in incognito window and join as viewer
5. ✅ **Expected**: Stream should NOT freeze

### 2. Test With Recording (Primary Test)

1. Go to `/live`
2. **Enable** "Record Stream"
3. **Enable** "Save to Storj" (if configured)
4. Fill stream title and start
5. Wait for "Recording Queued" toast
6. Immediately open incognito window and join as viewer
7. ✅ **Expected**: Stream should NOT freeze
8. ✅ **Expected**: After 3 seconds, "Recording Started" toast appears
9. ✅ **Expected**: Viewer count shows "1 watching" (not 2)

### 3. Test Multiple Viewers

1. Start stream with recording enabled
2. Open 3-4 different browsers/devices
3. Have all join within first 5 seconds
4. ✅ **Expected**: All viewers see smooth video
5. ✅ **Expected**: Broadcaster sees accurate viewer count
6. ✅ **Expected**: No freezing or disconnections

### 4. Test Connection Recovery

1. Start stream with recording
2. Join as viewer
3. Temporarily disable/enable network on broadcaster's device
4. ✅ **Expected**: "Reconnecting..." toast appears
5. ✅ **Expected**: "Reconnected" toast after recovery
6. ✅ **Expected**: Stream resumes smoothly

## Architecture Changes

### Before (Problematic)

```
Time 0ms:
  └─ Broadcaster publishes tracks
  └─ Stream marked live
  └─ Egress joins room (recorder)
  └─ Viewers see "live" ──────────┐
                                   │
Time 100ms:                        │
  └─ Viewer joins ←────────────────┘
  └─ ❌ FREEZE (too many simultaneous connections)
```

### After (Fixed)

```
Time 0ms:
  └─ Broadcaster publishes tracks
  └─ Stream marked live
  └─ Recording QUEUED (not started)
  
Time 100-2900ms:
  └─ Viewers can join freely ✅
  └─ Connection stable
  └─ Adaptive streaming optimizes
  
Time 3000ms:
  └─ Egress joins room (recorder)
  └─ Room already stable with viewers
  └─ ✅ NO FREEZE (delayed egress)
```

## Benefits of This Fix

1. ✅ **Eliminates Freeze**: Viewers can join immediately without conflicts
2. ✅ **Stable Recording**: Recording starts after connection is stable
3. ✅ **Better UX**: Users get feedback about recording queue
4. ✅ **Accurate Counts**: Viewer count excludes recorder
5. ✅ **Graceful Degradation**: Recording failure doesn't stop stream
6. ✅ **Easy Testing**: Recording can be disabled for debugging

## Performance Impact

- **Latency**: No added latency for viewers
- **Connection Time**: Same connection speed
- **Recording Start**: 3-second delay (acceptable tradeoff)
- **Memory**: Negligible increase
- **Bandwidth**: No change

## Monitoring

### Console Logs to Watch

**Successful Flow:**
```
🔴 Stream connected! Recording: true
✅ Stream marked as live in database
🎉 You're Live!
📹 Recording will start in 3 seconds to stabilize connection...
[3 seconds pass]
📹 Now starting recording...
✅ Recording started: EG_xxxxx
👤 Viewer joined: viewer-xxxxx
```

**Viewer Count:**
```
👤 Viewer joined: viewer-abc123
📹 Egress recorder joined (not counted as viewer)
[Viewer count: 1 watching]
```

### LiveKit Dashboard

Check in [LiveKit Cloud Dashboard](https://cloud.livekit.io):

1. Navigate to **Rooms** tab
2. Find active room (format: `stream-{userId}-{timestamp}`)
3. Check **Participants**:
   - 1 publisher (broadcaster)
   - N subscribers (viewers)
   - 1 hidden participant (egress recorder)
4. Check **Tracks**:
   - Video track published ✅
   - Audio track published ✅
5. Monitor **Connection Quality**

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Stream still freezes with recording enabled

**Try:**
1. Increase delay to 5 seconds in `Live.tsx`
2. Check browser console for WebRTC errors
3. Test without recording to isolate issue
4. Check LiveKit dashboard for connection quality
5. Verify no firewall blocking WebRTC

### Issue: Recording doesn't start

**Check:**
1. Console shows "Recording will start in 3 seconds"
2. After 3 seconds, check for egress errors
3. Verify Storj credentials (if enabled)
4. Check Supabase function logs: `supabase functions logs livekit-egress`
5. Recording failure shouldn't affect stream

### Issue: Viewer count includes recorder

**Verify:**
1. Egress participant has identity starting with `EG_`
2. Check console logs for "Egress recorder joined"
3. Verify filter logic in `InstantLiveStreamLiveKit.tsx`
