# Security & Permissions Fix Summary

## Issues Identified

1. **Admin controls showing on other users' profiles**: The "Save to Storj" button was appearing for all recordings, even when viewing someone else's profile
2. **Video access concerns**: Need to verify proper ownership filtering

## Fixes Applied

### 1. LiveStreamCard Component (`src/components/LiveStreamCard.tsx`)
- **Added `isOwner` prop** to control visibility of admin features
- **Updated interface** to include `user_id` and `isOwner` properties
- **Modified "Save to Storj" button** to only show when `isRecording && isOwner` is true
- This ensures users can only manage their own recordings

### 2. Profile Page (`src/pages/Profile.tsx`)
- **Passing `isOwner={isOwnProfile}`** to LiveStreamCard component
- Ensures admin controls only show when viewing your own profile
- The `isOwnProfile` state is correctly calculated by comparing `session?.user?.id === profileId`

### 3. Discover Page (`src/pages/Discover.tsx`)
- **Explicitly set `isOwner={false}`** for all recordings shown on discover page
- Public discovery pages should never show admin controls, even for your own content

### 4. ProfileEditDialog Component (`src/components/ProfileEditDialog.tsx`)
- **Added ownership verification** in `handleSave()` function
- **Added ownership verification** in `handleAvatarUpload()` function
- **Added ownership verification** in `handleBackgroundUpload()` function
- Checks that `session.user.id === profile.id` before allowing any modifications
- Shows "Unauthorized" error if user tries to edit someone else's profile

## Database Security Verification

Reviewed Row Level Security (RLS) policies in Supabase migrations:

### Assets Table
```sql
-- Users can update their own assets
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own assets"
ON public.assets
FOR UPDATE
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Users can delete their own assets
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own assets"
ON public.assets
FOR DELETE
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

### Profiles Table
```sql
-- Users can update their own profile
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own profile" 
ON public.profiles 
FOR UPDATE 
USING (auth.uid() = id);
```

**Result**: Database-level security is properly configured. Even if frontend checks were bypassed, the database would reject unauthorized modifications.

## Video Filtering

Verified that video queries are properly filtered:

### Videos Page (`src/pages/Videos.tsx`)
```typescript
.eq('user_id', session.user.id)  // Line 96
```
✅ Correctly filters to show only current user's videos

### Profile Page (`src/pages/Profile.tsx`)
```typescript
.eq('user_id', profileId)  // Line 89
```
✅ Correctly filters to show only the profile owner's videos

## Security Layers

This fix implements **defense in depth** with multiple security layers:

1. **UI Layer**: Controls (buttons, dialogs) only visible to authorized users
2. **Frontend Logic**: Ownership checks before API calls
3. **Database RLS**: Final enforcement at database level

## Testing Checklist

- ✅ No linter errors in modified files
- ✅ LiveStreamCard component properly receives isOwner prop
- ✅ Profile page correctly passes ownership information
- ✅ Discover page explicitly sets isOwner to false
- ✅ ProfileEditDialog has ownership verification
- ✅ Database RLS policies verified

## Next Steps for User Testing

1. Log in as User A
2. Navigate to your own profile - you should see "Save to Storj" button on your recordings
3. Navigate to User B's profile - you should NOT see "Save to Storj" button on their recordings
4. Try to edit your own profile - should work
5. Navigate to User B's profile and verify no "Edit Profile" button appears
6. Go to Videos page - you should only see your own videos
7. Go to Discover page - should see public videos from all users, but no admin controls

## Files Modified

- `src/components/LiveStreamCard.tsx`
- `src/pages/Profile.tsx`
- `src/pages/Discover.tsx`
- `src/components/ProfileEditDialog.tsx`

## Conclusion

The security vulnerabilities have been fixed with both frontend and backend protections. Users can now only:
- See their own videos in their Videos page
- Edit only their own profile
- See admin controls only on their own content
