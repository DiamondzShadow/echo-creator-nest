# 🎯 NFT Marketplace V2 - Enhanced Version

## What Changed?

Your NFT Marketplace has been **significantly strengthened** with security improvements and best practices from ThirdWeb.

---

## 🔥 Top 3 Improvements

### 1. **20% Royalty Cap** 🛡️
**Before**: No limit on royalties (malicious contracts could claim 100%)  
**After**: Maximum 20% royalty enforced

```solidity
// Automatically caps excessive royalties
if (royaltyAmount > maxRoyalty) {
    royaltyAmount = maxRoyalty; // Max 20%
}
```

---

### 2. **Listing Expiration** ⏰
**Before**: Listings stayed forever  
**After**: 1-365 day expiration (default 90 days)

```solidity
// Listings now expire automatically
expiresAt: block.timestamp + duration

// Anyone can mark expired
function expireListing(uint256 listingId)

// Sellers can extend
function extendListing(uint256 listingId, uint256 additionalTime)
```

---

### 3. **Pull Payment Pattern** 💰
**Before**: Direct ETH transfers (could fail and revert)  
**After**: Withdraw pattern (safer and gas-efficient)

```solidity
// Funds go to pending withdrawals
pendingWithdrawals[seller] += amount;

// Sellers/buyers withdraw when ready
function withdraw() external
```

## 🚀 New Functions You Can Use

### For Sellers:
```javascript
// List with 30-day expiration
await marketplace.listNFT(nft, tokenId, price, token, 30 * 24 * 60 * 60);

// Extend listing by 30 days
await marketplace.extendListing(listingId, 30 * 24 * 60 * 60);

// Withdraw earnings after sale
await marketplace.withdraw();
```

### For Anyone:
```javascript
// Mark expired listings
await marketplace.expireListing(listingId);

// Check pending withdrawal
const pending = await marketplace.pendingWithdrawals(address);
```

---

## ⚠️ Important Changes for Frontend

### 1. listNFT Now Has 5 Parameters (was 4)
```typescript
// OLD
listNFT(nftContract, tokenId, price, paymentToken)

// NEW - added duration
listNFT(nftContract, tokenId, price, paymentToken, duration)
// Use 0 for default 90 days
```

### 2. Sellers Must Withdraw After Sale
```typescript
// After selling
const pending = await marketplace.pendingWithdrawals(sellerAddress);
if (pending > 0) {
  await marketplace.withdraw();
}
```

### 3. Show Expiration Status
```typescript
const listing = await marketplace.getListing(listingId);
const expired = Date.now() > listing.expiresAt * 1000;
```

```bash
# 1. Test royalty cap
✓ NFT with 10% royalty (normal)
✓ NFT with 50% royalty (should cap at 20%)

# 2. Test expiration
✓ List with various durations
✓ Buy before expiration (works)
✓ Buy after expiration (fails)
✓ Extend listing

# 3. Test pull payment
✓ Buy NFT
✓ Check pending withdrawal
✓ Withdraw funds
✓ Try double withdrawal (fails)

# 4. Test edge cases
✓ Expire listing after time
✓ List with 0 duration (uses 90 days)
✓ Gas costs comparison
```
