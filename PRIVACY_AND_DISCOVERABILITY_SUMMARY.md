**Date:** 2025-10-31  
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED  
**Branch:** `cursor/investigate-video-privacy-issue-across-profiles-3abc`

---

## Overview

This document summarizes all fixes applied to address critical privacy vulnerabilities and discoverability issues in CrabbyTV.

---

## üîí Privacy Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Videos Visible Across All Profiles
**Problem:** All videos were PUBLIC by default and visible to everyone, regardless of the uploader's intent.

**Root Cause:** Database column `is_public` defaulted to `true`

**Solution:**
- Changed default to `false` (private by default)
- Added migration: `20251031000000_fix_video_privacy_defaults.sql`
- Updated Discover page to filter `is_public = true`
- Maintained RLS policy enforcement

**Impact:**
- ‚úÖ New videos are private by default
- ‚úÖ Users must explicitly make videos public
- ‚úÖ Clear UI indicators (Lock/Unlock icons)
- ‚úÖ Privacy toggle in Videos page

### Issue 2: Edit Functions Not Restricted to Owner
**Problem:** Edit operations didn't verify ownership, potential security gap.

**Solution:**
- Added ownership verification in `VideoEditDialog.tsx`
- Added ownership check in privacy toggle
- Uses `.eq('user_id', session.user.id)` in all update queries
- RLS policies already enforce ownership at DB level

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/VideoEditDialog.tsx` - Lines 85-128
- `src/pages/Videos.tsx` - Lines 136-169

**Security Checks:**
1. Session verification (must be logged in)
2. Ownership fetch and compare
3. Explicit owner check in UPDATE query
4. RLS policy as final enforcement layer

## üîç Discoverability Issues Fixed

### Issue 3: No Way to Find Creators
**Problem:** Creators page existed at `/creators` with full search functionality but was NOT linked anywhere in navigation.

**Solution:**
- Added "Discover" button to navbar
- Added "Find Creators" button to navbar
- Available to ALL users (logged in or not)
- Both mobile and desktop navigation updated

**Features Now Accessible:**
- ‚úÖ Search creators by name/username
- ‚úÖ Most Followed leaderboard
- ‚úÖ Most Tipped leaderboard
- ‚úÖ Browse all creators with avatars
- ‚úÖ Sort by followers/tips

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/Navbar.tsx`

### Issue 4: No Live Stream Notifications
**Problem:** When creators went live, viewers had no way to know unless they manually checked the Discover page.

**Solution:**
- Created `LiveStreamNotification` component
- Real-time WebSocket subscriptions to `live_streams` table
- Shows banner at top of screen when streams go live
- Dismissible per-stream
- Shows up to 5 concurrent live streams

**Features:**
- üî¥ Red banner with "LIVE NOW" indicator
- Avatar, creator name, stream title
- Viewer count display
- One-click "Watch" button
- Dismiss button
- Filters out user's own streams
- Animated slide-down entrance

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/LiveStreamNotification.tsx`

**Files Modified:**
- `src/App.tsx` - Integrated notification banner
- `tailwind.config.ts` - Added slide-down animation
