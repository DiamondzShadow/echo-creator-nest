## 🔧 Automatic Deployment (Lovable)

Since you're using **Lovable**, the deployment is **AUTOMATIC**:

### ✅ Already Deployed:
- All frontend code changes
- Web3 configurations
- Component integrations

### 🔄 Will Auto-Deploy on Push:
- Supabase Edge Function (`record-video-tip`)
- Database Migration (`video_tips` table)

### What You Need to Do:
1. **Push to your branch** - Lovable will handle the rest
2. **Verify in Supabase Dashboard** - Check that:
   - `video_tips` table exists
   - `record-video-tip` function is deployed
3. **Test with testnet first** - Use Polygon Mumbai or similar

---

## 🚀 Quick Start Testing

### Test on Testnet (Recommended First):

1. **Switch to testnet** in MetaMask (e.g., Polygon Mumbai)
2. **Get testnet tokens** from faucet
3. **Connect wallet** on your site
4. **Find a video** with creator who has wallet connected
5. **Click "Tip Video"** and send 0.01 test ETH
6. **Verify transaction** completes
7. **Check database** for new record in `video_tips` table

### Verify in Database:
```sql
-- Check if table exists
SELECT * FROM video_tips LIMIT 1;

-- View recent tips
SELECT 
  vt.*,
  a.title as video_title,
  p.username as creator
FROM video_tips vt
JOIN assets a ON vt.video_id = a.id
JOIN profiles p ON vt.to_user_id = p.id
ORDER BY vt.created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Tip button doesn't appear
**Solution:** Creator must have `wallet_address` set in their profile
```sql
UPDATE profiles 
SET wallet_address = '0x...' 
WHERE id = 'creator-user-id';
```

### Issue: Transaction fails
**Possible causes:**
- Insufficient gas
- Wrong network selected
- Contract not deployed on that network
- Wallet not connected

### Issue: Tip doesn't record in database
**Check:**
1. Edge function logs in Supabase
2. Browser console for errors
3. Transaction status on block explorer
4. Database migration applied

### Issue: Edge function not deployed
**Solution:**
```bash
supabase functions deploy record-video-tip
```
